## memex

`memex` is a minimal personal wiki that serves pages rendered from markdown,

through tracking backlinks using a graph structure

###### disclaimer

this software is being actively worked on, most concepts and solutions within
the codebase are provisional and likely inefficient. it is riddled with
`.clone()` and ugly solutions. this is expected to change during development.
